Interface
An Interface is a description of the action that an object can do.
Interface is written in the same way as the class the declaration with interface keyword.

Rules of Interface:

1) All Methods in the interface must be public; this is the nature of an interface.
2) All Methods in the interface must be implemented within the class; failure to do so will result in a fatal error.
3) The class implementing the interface must use the exact same method signatures as are defined in the interface.
4) Interfaces can be extended like the class using the extends operator.

Notes on Interface: 
1) We cannot create objects to interface, but the class implementing the interface can have objects.
2) We cannot define a variable in an interface.
3) If we extend interface all the methods of the interface must be implemented in the child class.
